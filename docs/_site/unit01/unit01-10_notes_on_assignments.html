<p>Within this course, you will individually submit your personal solutions for the course assignments to your personal GitHub-hosted learning log, i.e. your personal classroom repository. Don’t get confused about “your personal repository”.

<p>The classroom repository will be created automatically by following a link to the respective classroom assignment which will be provided by the instructors. Your classroom repository will be hosted as part of GeoMOER, our learning log space at GitHub for Marburg Open Educational Resources.</p>

<p>If not stated otherwise, the deadline for an assignment is the date and time of the next course session. The submissions generally encompass R or R markdown with compiled html files.</p>

<p>Now it’s time for your first R code which will be put into an R markdown document.</p>

<h2 id="working-environment">Working environment</h2>
<p>For this course, we do not provide a mandatory template for your working environment. However it is a good idea to have something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>top level folder for this course, e.g. *<some-path-to-your-data-disk>\data_analysis*,</some-path-to-your-data-disk></li>
  <li>a <em>data</em> folder within your top level folder which also contains a <em>tmp</em> folder for temporary files and different subfolders for datasets and/or assignments within this course,</li>
  <li>a folder for your personal GitHub classroom repository and different subfolders within, one for each assignment and one for scripts and functions which are useful for more than one assignment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, your data structure could look like this:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">&lt;some-path-to-your-data-disk&gt;\data_analysis</span>
  <span class="s">|-- data</span>
