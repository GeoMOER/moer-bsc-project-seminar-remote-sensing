  <li>Extent a copy of the above statement (i.e. copy the entire if-then-else statement and include it a second time in your script in order to preserve both versions) which returns “equal” and “smaller” explicitly in addition to “larger”.</li>
  <li>Implement a if-then-else statement which prints “even” if the number provided as variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> is even and which prints “odd” otherwise.</li>
  <li>Copy the extended larger/equal/smaller if-then-else statement and include it into a for loop which shows that all three options are actually implemented in a correct manner by iterating over <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> from a number which is smaller 1, exactly 1 and larger than 1.</li>
  <li>Extent a copy of the above loop and modify the loop and if-then-else statement in such a way, that the information on “larger” etc. is not printed on the screen but saved within a vector (i.e. a variable which will hold all three statements in the end). Print the content of this vector after the loop.</li>
  <li>Extent a copy of the above modified loop in such a way, that the results are not saved in a vector but a list. Print the content of this list after the loop.</li>
  <li>Change the above modified loop in such a way, that the iteration is controlled by a <code class="highlighter-rouge">lapply</code> not by a for-loop. Save the returning information from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lapply</code> function in a variable and print the content of this variable after the loop.</li>
  <li>Finally change the above variable (i.e. do not modify the loop anymore but just include one more line) in such a way that the content is not printed as a nested list but a vector (i.e. flatten the list).</li>
