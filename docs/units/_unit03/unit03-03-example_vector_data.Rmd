## Setup the working environment

For handling vector data we will use the `sf` package. Basically simple features (hence sf) is just a data frame where the rows are the entities and the columns are the attributes. All that differentiates a sf from a data frame is the *geometry column*. In this column, all the spatial information about the entity is stored, including geometry type, coordinates and reference system.  

It is a good idea to have a look at the sf-vignette to get some 


Most of the functions in `sf` begin with `st_`
```{r}
# load the simple features package
library(sf)
```
## Working with sf and geopackage

You can download the dataset here. A geopackage can consist of multiple layers with different geometry types. Let's have a look what's inside the sample data with `st_layers()`.

```{r}


st_layers("mof_supplementary.gpkg")



```
