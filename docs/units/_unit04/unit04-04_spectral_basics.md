title: "The light spectrum or Why does remote sensing work?"
--- 

For the understanding of why multispectral remote sensing works, it is good idea to recap some physics (mainly optics)
and how light and color works.

## Light, Color and Wavelengths

First of all we regard light as a wave with certain wavelength. Different wavelength of light appear to humans as different colors because we have three different
cone cells in the eye which react to different wavelengths. The three wavelengths appear to us as **red**, **green** and **blue**.
All other colors are a mixture of these three primary colors.

Although sunlight appears white, it consists of a multitude of different wavelengths. Objects appear colorful to us, because they absorb and reflect certain wavelengths.
Multispectral remote sensing makes use of this by relating the reflectance information to different features of the landscape.
