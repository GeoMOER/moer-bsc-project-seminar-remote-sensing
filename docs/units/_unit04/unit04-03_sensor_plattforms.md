## Footprint and spatial resolution

The three most common satellite platforms for multispectral imagery are MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), Landsat and Sentinel-2.

![from: Conservation Technology Series Issue 4: SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING FOR CONSERVATION ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aurelie_Shapiro/publication/324537528/figure/fig2/AS:631598739386389@1527596282634/Clockwise-from-top-left-Comparison-of-the-footprint-of-three-scenes-from-different_W640.jpg)

Airborn imagery or cameras on unmanned aerial systems (Drones, UAV, UAS) have an even smaller footprint but usually a spatial resolution between 2 cm and 1 m.


## Temporal Aspects

The orbit time determines how frequent we will get an image at a given spot on earth (e.g. Marburg).
For MODIS we will get imagery at least every 2 days. Landsat has a temporal resolution of 16 days.
Sentinel-2 consists of two satellites (2A and 2B) and therefore has a combined temporal resolution of 5 days.

Not only the image frequency is relevant but sometimes also the launch date of a satellite system.
E.g. for long term change analysis of the landscape, Sentinel-2 is not suitable because the first images from Sentinel-2A are from 2015.
Landsat would be a better choice here. It startet in 1972. MODIS in 1999.
