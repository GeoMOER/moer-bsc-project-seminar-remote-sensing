## Active vs. Passive

#### Passive Sensors

The most common remote sensing imagery comes from passive multispectral sensors. The sensor "picks up" the natural light comming from the
sun and its reflectance on the earths surface.
The images is similar to a photography with a digital camera and consits of different channels for each wavelength.
Most multispectral platforms have at least 3 spectral channels (blue, green, red / RGB) and up to 12. 
Hyperspectral sensors take this to the next level and consist of > 100 channels for different wavelengths.


#### Active Sensors

Active sensors emit their radiation by themself. Therefore they are less dependend on environmental conditions like the sun angle.
The long wavelength of a radar sensor e.g. can penetrate through clouds which makes imagery more consistent.
In future lessons we will see how Lidar data works and what information can be retrieved from it.
