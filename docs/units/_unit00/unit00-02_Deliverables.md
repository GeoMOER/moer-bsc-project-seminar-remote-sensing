We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Pr√ºfungsleistung"). 
Both are required for passing the course but only the latter is marked, making up your final grade for the course.

Students will need to deliver unmarked assignments on a regular basis ("homework") and must end the course with a (team) project, which will be marked.
Details on the individual assignments and whether or not they will be marked can be found in the respective units.


## Where to upload
Upload your files in the right assignment folder in ILIAS. The right assignment folder has in its folder name the number of the assignment for uploading.
If you like to upload your third assignment, for example, then you have to upload your files into the folder called "Assignment 03".

## When to upload at the latest
Upload your assignments to ILIAS at least 15 minutes before the start of the next session.
