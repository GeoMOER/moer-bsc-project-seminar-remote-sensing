* a method section with details on the methods you plan to apply on your data for getting an answer to you research question,
* a discussion section, where you discuss the implications, conclusions, potential limitations and improvements, picking up the story you created in the introduction, 
* a timetable with important work packages and milestones you aim to work on for reaching the project goal, and 
* references on relevant scientific papers, which have been published in the context of your research question.

Note that the project outline should not exceed two pages.
These pages will help the instructors to give feedback on especially the feasibility of your project. 


# Feedback
Feedback on the outline will be given at the session on **to be determined**. 
On the one hand, it is necessary to submit the outline in time, so that there is enough time for the instructors to prepare feedback.

In order to make the feedback understandable for everyone, your group should briefly present your outline within 5 minutes. 
No slides are needed, the two-page outline is sufficient.
