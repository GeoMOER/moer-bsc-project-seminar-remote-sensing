Apply your gained knowledge in your own project work.

<!--more-->

You now have all the tools available your own machine learning project work.
There are several posibilities on what your can work on:


## Improving the predictions

The random forest models and predictions of the mean vegetation height in Unit 6 were not that great.
You could now focus on improving the model by using additional predictors, more training data or multi-temporal satellite imagery.



## Comparison of model types

You could compare random forest with other model types like support vector machines or a neural network.


## Different response variable

During the course we used the mean vegetation height as an example. Of course you can try to model a different Lidar derived index.
