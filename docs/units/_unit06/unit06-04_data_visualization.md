Before you build your model, it is a good idea to get a feeling about your data with some visualizations.

* Plot histogram of each predictor using the dataframe. What can you learn from this plot?
* Create a histogram of the Mean Vegetation Height. Think again about what this value actually represents.


## Uploading assignment to Ilias
Finalize the two exercises (i.e., Exercise 1 and Exercise 2) and create an HTML file from your Rmd file by knitting it. Then upload both files (i.e., Rmd and html) to Ilias. 
See [here]({{"../unit00/unit00-02_Deliverables.html#assignments" | baseURL }}){:target="_blank"} for where exactly to place your files as well as for the file naming conventions.
